abstract = {Theoretical development of a nonlinear aeroelastic analysis for high-aspect-ratio wings is presented. The analysis couples a geometrically exact beam theory with a nonplanar aerodynamic theory. The aim of the present effort is to investigate the effects of geometrical nonlinearities on the aeroelastic behavior of high-aspect-ratio wings. The focus of the present work is on characterizing the physical origins of nonlinearities and assessing their relative importance. Results presented show that the structural geometrical nonlinearities have a significant effect on the structural dynamics and on the dynamic aeroelastic characteristics of a high-aspect-ratio wing. The geometrically exact calculation of the angle of attack and aerodynamically consistent application of the airloads is also important for accurate aeroelastic characterization. On the other hand, the geometrical aerodynamic nonlinearity emerging from the nonplanar wake effects is quite negligible. Nonplanar effects were negligible for both the steady and unsteady airload calculations with the assumption of a fixed wake model.}

    abstract = { This study considers the effect of geometric nonlinearity at the design concept stage of an aircraft wing. A nonlinear finite element beam model adopting the finite volumes concept with an intrinsic strain and curvature formulation is used to size a single-aisle passenger aircraft. A linearized version of this geometrically nonlinear formulation provides a linear benchmark from which the nonlinear predictions of loads, weight, and performance can be compared. A baseline study on a wing with an aspect ratio of 18 shows that geometric nonlinearity can have a significant impact on the internal loads, leading to a reduction in the wing weight. The effect of aspect ratio is also explored, yielding optimal values at which the Breguet range is maximized and showing the effect of geometric nonlinearity on that range. This is complemented by a parameter study on the effect of varying the wing span and surface area, showing that, if gate limitations in the form of span constraints are imposed on the sizing, the optimal aspect ratio is significantly reduced and geometrically nonlinear effects are mitigated. The paper demonstrates the correlation between geometric nonlinearity and the improvements in the wing mass and Breguet range as compared to a conventional linear analysis. }

abstract={Distributed electric propulsion (DEP) uses multiple propellers driven by motors distributed along the leading edge of the wing to produce beneficial aerodynamic interactions. However, the wing will be in the sliding flow of the propeller and the lift and drag characteristics of the wing will change accordingly. The performance of the propeller will also be affected by the wing in its rear. In this paper, combined with wind tunnel tests, the low Reynolds aerodynamic properties of multiple DEP structures are numerically simulated by solving the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation of multiple reference frames (MRF) or slip grid technology. The results demonstrate that the lift and drag of DEP increase in all cases, with the magnitude depending on the angle of attack (AOA) and the relative positions of propellers and wing. When the AOA is less than 16{\textdegree} (stall AOA), the change of lift is not affected by it. By contrast, when the AOA is greater than 16{\textdegree} the L/D (lift-to-drag ratio) of the DEP system increases significantly. This is because the propeller slipstream delays laminar flow separation and increases the stall AOA. At the same time, the inflow and the downwash effect, which is generated on both sides of the rotating shaft, result in the actual AOA of the wing being greater than the free flow AOA with a fluctuation distribution of the lift coefficient along the span. Also, for the propeller in the DEP, the blocking effect of the wing and the vortex of the trailing edge of the wing result in a significant increase in thrust.},

    abstract = { Next-generation aircraft designs often incorporate multiple large propellers attached along the wingspan (distributed electric propulsion), leading to highly flexible dynamic systems that can exhibit aeroelastic instabilities. This paper introduces a validated methodology to investigate the aeroelastic instabilities of wing–propeller systems and to understand the dynamic mechanism leading to wing and whirl flutter and transition from one to the other. Factors such as nacelle positions along the wing span and chord and its propulsion system mounting stiffness are considered. Additionally, preliminary design guidelines are proposed for flutter-free wing–propeller systems applicable to novel aircraft designs. The study demonstrates how the critical speed of the wing–propeller systems is influenced by the mounting stiffness and propeller position. Weak mounting stiffnesses result in whirl flutter, while hard mounting stiffnesses lead to wing flutter. For the latter, the position of the propeller along the wing span may change the wing mode shapes and thus the flutter mechanism. Propeller positions closer to the wing tip enhance stability, but pusher configurations are more critical due to the mass distribution behind the elastic axis. }

    abstract = { Folding wingtips have begun to feature on recent aircraft designs, as a solution for compliance with existing airport gate width regulations while enabling high-aspect-ratio wings for lower induced drag and better overall fuel efficiency. Recent studies have suggested that by allowing folding of the wingtip during flight, additional gust load alleviation can be achieved. This paper describes the first experimental study of the folding wingtip concept, when applied to a highly flexible, high-aspect-ratio wing. Using a low-speed wind tunnel with a vertical gust generator, the experiment examined the load alleviation performance through a range of one-minus-cosine gust inputs and found up to 11\% reduction in peak wing-root bending moment. In addition, a movable secondary aerodynamic surface was fitted to the folding wingtip, which demonstrated that such a device was able to control the orientation of the folding wingtip effectively in steady aerodynamic conditions, as well as achieving further reduction in peak wing-root bending moment during gust encounters through active control. }

    abstract = { Active gust load alleviation techniques exhibit a high potential in significantly reducing the transient gust loads on aircraft. In this work the aerodynamic potential of trailing-edge flaps and leading-edge flaps is numerically studied with the purpose to significantly reduce the structural gust loads. The utilized spanwise-segmented flaps represent slight modifications of existing devices for high-lift and maneuvering. The investigations based on unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations are conducted by employing a generic wing–fuselage aircraft configuration at transonic flow conditions. Idealized discrete “1−cos”-type vertical gusts that are relevant for the certification process are used as representative atmospheric disturbances. The focus of this paper is to introduce a practicable prediction method for required trailing- and leading-edge flap deflections for a significant mitigation of gust-induced wing loads. The three-dimensional flap deflections are determined by parametric two-dimensional simulations at representative wing sections. Different extensions of the estimation approach are investigated to assess the influence of the wing planform, the finite wing span, the aerodynamic phase lags, and the flap scheduling. It is shown that the trailing- and leading-edge flaps are promising in terms of alleviation of gust-induced wing bending and wing torsional moments, respectively. However, at high leading-edge flap deflections that are necessary for a full compensation of the wing torsional moment large-scale flow separation is identified. The introduced gust load alleviation approach indicates a good transferability between two-dimensional airfoil and three-dimensional wing aerodynamics for unsteady flap deflections. }

ABSTRACT = {With the increasing use of composite materials in aviation, structural aircraft design often becomes limited by stiffness, rather than strength. As a consequence, aeroelastic analysis becomes more important to optimize both aircraft structures and control algorithms. A low computational cost aeroelasticity model based on VLM and rigid-body dynamics is proposed in this work. UAV flight testing is performed to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed model. Two flight sections are chosen to be modeled based on recorded aerodynamic surface control data. The calculated accelerations are compared with recorded flight data. It is found that the proposed model adequately captures the general flight profile, with acceleration peak errors between −6.2% and +8.4%. The average relative error during the entire flight section is 39% to 44%, mainly caused by rebounds during the beginning and end of pull-up maneuvers. The model could provide useful results for the initial phases of aircraft control law design when comparing different control algorithms.},

    abstract = { This paper introduces a multifidelity method that can produce accurate estimates of the flutter boundary at a reduced cost by combining information from low- and high-fidelity aeroelastic models. Estimating the flutter boundary in the presence of nonlinear aerodynamic phenomena is challenging because high-fidelity aeroelastic models are expensive to evaluate, and flutter analysis requires many model evaluations. On the other hand, relatively inexpensive approximate aeroelastic models (low-fidelity models) exist and are routinely applied to reduce the cost of estimating flutter, albeit with lower accuracy. The multifidelity method introduced here uses an active learning algorithm to leverage information from low-fidelity models. A multifidelity statistical surrogate is used to fit damping coefficient estimates computed with different aeroelastic models. This surrogate is used to estimate the uncertainty in the prediction of the flutter boundary, which drives the selection of new evaluations. The effectiveness of the multifidelity method is demonstrated by estimating the aeroelastic flutter boundary of a typical section model at a cost 85\% lower when compared with the bisection method. Four aeroelastic models are considered in this example: three models (including the high-fidelity model) use a computational fluid dynamics solver based on the Euler equations, whereas one model uses a two-dimensional doublet-lattice method. }

abstract = {Flying-wing unmanned aerial vehicles have received extensive attention over the past decade because of their excellent aerodynamic and stealth performance. However, the aeroelastic interaction problems among unsteady aerodynamics, flight dynamics, and structural dynamics, such as the body-freedom flutter, are still open. This paper presents the study of a robust control scheme for active body-freedom flutter suppression of a flexible flying-wing unmanned aerial vehicle. The control objective is to expand the boundary of body-freedom flutter and to enhance the control robustness to external unknown disturbance simultaneously. The paper begins with the modeling procedure of a parameter-varying aeroservoelastic plant for the design of control law. Then, it presents how to synthesize a robust controller so as to suppress the flutter instability for a wide flight range of dynamic pressures. Afterwards, the paper shows how to analyze the flutter stability of the closed-loop system and the robustness of the controller, respectively. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed robust controller can not only expand the flutter boundary of the unmanned aerial vehicle by 30%, but also exhibit the strong robustness to external disturbance.}
